# Mounted Warfare

A fast, stylish vehicular-combat homage to Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense — but instead of cars, you pilot extravagant mounts (mastodonts, larvae, stilt‑ticks, wind machines, oared galleys, and other Atlantean/biopunk contraptions) crewed by odd humanoid cultures. Think: Monster Hunter meets Vigilante 8 set in a colorful Avatar x Star Wars frontier.


## The Twist
- No cars. “Vehicles” are creatures and primitive/fantastical machines.
- Piloting is shared: the mount and one/many riders (health split, roles).
- Weapons range from blades/bows to animistic magic and bio‑devices (exploding fauna, flame‑throwing fauna, light‑emitting impacts, etc.).

## Core Gameplay Loop (MVP)
1. Enter an arena as a chosen mount+crew.
2. Collect pickups (weapons, ammo, repair, boosts).
3. Fight AI rivals; use positioning, unique movement, and hardpoints.
4. Earn salvage on kills/assists; between rounds, upgrade offense/defense/speed/targeting.
5. Visuals reflect upgrades (attachments, plating, totems, pods).

## Early Scope (MVP)
- Camera: third‑person chase 
- Single‑player vs bots
- 1 test arena (obstacles, hazards, pickup spawners)
- 1 flagship mount (Mastodont) + basic movement model
- 2–3 weapons (rockets, mines, optional autocannon)
- Simple AI drivers (patrol → engage → evade)
- Salvage upgrades (tiered: offense/defense/speed/targeting)

## Systems Overview
- Movement: weighty, readable; mount‑specific quirks later (brachiating, skimming, stomping).
- Weapons: lock‑ons, splash, proximity traps; each with unique ammo and fire modes.
- Pickups: weapon crates, ammo, repair, armor, speed/boost.
- Salvage: earn in matches; spend to improve stats and attach visible parts.
- Health Model: split HP for mount and rider(s); armor mitigation and hit zones.

## Aesthetic Direction
- “Atlantean Star Wars”: saturated colors, bold silhouettes, readable VFX.
- Biopunk tech: creatures as mechanisms; ritual trappings; totems and textiles.
- Environments: evocative, odd geography; practical hazards; minimal text/lore.

## Roadmap (Short-Term)
- Prototype driving and combat feel (1 mount, 2 weapons, 1 arena).
- Add pickups and salvage loop; confirm visual upgrade feedback.
- Bot behaviors and lock‑on/special weapon pass.
- Juice pass: SFX, VFX, hit feedback, concise combat logs.

## Longer-Term Ideas
- 10+ species (cultures/tech trees → unique mounts and weapons).
- Mobility mods (skis, hover pods, grapnels) per environment.
- Co‑op hunts and multi‑crew mounts with role actions.

## Design Pillars
- Distinct silhouettes (every mount is instantly recognizable).
- Tactile readability (movement and impact always clear).
- Expressive builds (mechanically and visually meaningful upgrades).
